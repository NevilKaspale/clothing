	<h1 class="top"><u>Donate Clothes Here!!</u></h1>
	<p class="first">So, you’re ready to clean out your closet. You have a lot of clothes that you don’t wear anymore, and you’re ready to revamp your wardrobe. While you’re doing that, you’re probably wondering what you’re going to do with all the old clothes. Before you throw them in the trash, consider donating them.</p>
	<h2 id="que">Why donate clothes?</h2>
	<ul><li><h4 class="ans">Helps People Who Can't Afford Clothes</h4>
	<p class="second">Thrift stores run by charitable organizations typically provide the only way the homeless and other disadvantaged people can afford clothes. The organizations you donate to could not afford to carry out their work without your donated clothing items. Organizations such as the Salvation Army and Goodwill regularly sell clothing items at deeply discounted prices. Goodwill uses 82 percent of its revenues for training and employment for people with disabilities. The Salvation Army’s revenues from clothing sales go to support a number of community projects the organization supports, such as homeless shelters, rehabilitation centers and family emergency services.</p></li>
	<li><h4 class="ans">Helps Disaster Victims</h4>
	<p class="second">Though the Federal Emergency Management Agency prefers cash to help disaster relief efforts, clothing donations also help. Instead of donating directly to FEMA, choose a reputable organization that helps disaster survivors.</p></li>
	<li><h4 class="ans">Helps the Environment</h4></li>
	<p class="second">When you donate clothes to organizations that sell them in thrift stores, such as Goodwill, you are helping the environment. If people buy used clothing instead of new, fewer new clothes need to be made. This saves the resources used to create new textiles.</p>
